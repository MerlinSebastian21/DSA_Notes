**Eigenvectors**
- Vectors that remain in the same direction after a linear transformation.
- Do not change direction under transformation
**Eigenvalues**
- Scalars associated with Eigenvectors
- Represent the factor by which the eigenvector is scaled during the 

**UV Decomposition** commonly known as **Single Value Decomposition (SVD)**
Matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices.
