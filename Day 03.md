Ethical Considerations in AI"

**Neural Network**: A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way inspired by the human brain.
A deep neural network is an artificial neural network that is incorporated with many layers amid the network's input and output layers.

**Correlation Vs Causation**
Causation means action A causes outcome B. On the other hand, correlation is simply a relationship where action A relates to action Bâ€”but one event doesn't necessarily cause the other event to happen. 

Machine Learning Models
Supervised: Supervised learning involves training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, where each input data point is associated with a corresponding output or label. 
It is typically used for classification or prediction tasks. 
Unsupervised: This type of analysis deals with data without labels. It is used to find patterns or relationships within the data, often through clustering or dimensionality reduction.

**PYTHON**
- High-Level language
- Object-oriented language
-  Interpreter Language

Python Libraries : 
- **Pandas**: Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
- **Numpy**: NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

**scikit-learn** is a free and open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language.
