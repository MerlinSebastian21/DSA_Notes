  Frequentist definition of probability

**Law of Large numbers**
  -It states that the more experiments we run, the closer we will tend to get the expected probability.

  Events(any one of the possible outcomes) and Sample Spaces (set of all possible outcomes)
  -Coin toss example
  -Dice throwing example

  Dependent(eg: dice roll, P(2/even)=1/3) & Independent Events( won't depend on the previous event. eg: coin toss,getting two Heads,two tosses)
  - Joint Probability
      - An example of joint probability is rolling two dice and looking for the probability that both show the number three. Since the outcome of one die does not affect the other, you can calculate the joint probability by multiplying the probabilities of each event. The probability of one die showing a three is 1/6, so for two dice, the joint probability is:
P(3 on die 1 and 3 on die 2) = P(3 on die 1) * P(3 on die 2) = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36.

  - Marginal Probability - Marginal probability is the probability of a single event irrespective of any other event.
    - To find the marginal probability of event A, we add the probabilities where A occurs:

      P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B) = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5.

      This shows that the probability of event A occurring, irrespective of event B, is 0.5.
  
  Conditional Probability
    -similarity to hypothesis testing

  Bayes Theorem
    - Likelihood
    - Posterior
    - Prior
  example: Probability of Rainy given Cloudy

  Essence of Information Theory (minimum number of bits needed to share a piece of information)
  - Quantifying uncertainty
    (if the probability of an event increases then uncertainty decreases and vice versa )
  - Entropy
