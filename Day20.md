Datatypes -
  - Continues: eg temp
  - Discrete: eg grades(A,B,C)
  - Classification and Regression

Visualization
  - Matplotlib
      - Figures (input data)
      - Axis labels ( labels :predict data)
      - Sub-figures
      - Ticks
   
  Type of plots
   - Line plot
   - Bar charts
   - Pie Chart
   - Histogram
   -  CDF plot
   -  KDE plot
   -  Scatter plot
       - with color
   - Heat maps
   - Box Plots
- Seaborn
  Data types
  - Categorical data : eg : high,low,median; car name
   According to the discrete or continuous datatypes, there are two types of models
- Classification
- Regression
EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis ( Matplotlib)
## Features and Labels
  - Text data
      - BoW - Bag of words
      - TFIDF

Feature Engineering
- Feature Orthogonality ( model data with extreme ends are taken while training )
    - cosine Similarity ( if u and v are orthogonal then cosine similary = 0)
- Feature Colinearity ( f1,f2,f3 where f2 = 1.5 f1 then we say there is feature colinarity btn f1 and f2)
- Feature Slicing ( data D ,if there is inbalanced slicing then we divide the dataset into two models D1 and D2 ,then train them differently)
- Indicator Variable( adding new feature based on a condition for eg 0 for height<150 1 for Height> 150)
- Feature Binning 

 - Mathematical Transforms
   - Logarithms
   - FFT & STFT
