## Sampling
a process in statistical analysis in which researchers take a predetermined number of observations from a larger population.
- Population
- Sample
#### Central Limit Theorem
  In probability theory, the central limit theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of a sample will approximate a normal distribution (i.e., a bell curve) as the sample size becomes larger, regardless of the population's actual distribution shape.

#### Significance Level (Alpha)
 the probability that the event could have occurred by chance. If the level is quite low, that is, the probability of occurring by chance is quite small, we say the event is significant.
#### P-Value
 A p-value measures the probability of obtaining the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
## Z-test
A z-test is a statistical test to determine whether two population means are different or to compare one mean to a hypothesized value when the variances are known and the sample size is large.
